Welcome to pygada's documentation!
==================================
A python package to perform automated exploratory and geostatistical data-analysis.

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://pygada.readthedocs.io

Introduction
------------

It is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/DOV-Vlaanderen/pygada>`_ and development is coordinated by `Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen (DOV) <https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be>`_. \
DOV aggregates data about soil, subsoil and groundwater of Flanders and makes them publicly available.
With this package DOV offers a tool to perform data-analysis on the data from DOV. Nevertheless this package also works for a private dataset.

To get started see the documentation at https://pygada.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Please note that using DOV data with pygada is governed by the same `disclaimer <https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/page/disclaimer>`_ that applies to the other DOV services. Be sure to consult it when using DOV data with pygada.

*This repository is currently being build up based on the thesis work of Guillaume Vandekerckhove, pygeostat.*

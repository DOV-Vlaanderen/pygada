pygada is a python package to perform automated exploratory and geostatistical data-analysis.
      
test    

It is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DOV-Vlaanderen/pygada) and development is coordinated by [Databank Ondergrond Vlaanderen (DOV)](https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be). \
DOV aggregates data about soil, subsoil and groundwater of Flanders and makes them publicly available.
With this package DOV offers a tool to perform data-analysis on the data from DOV. Nevertheless, this package also works for a private dataset.

To get started, see the documentation at https://pygada.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

Please note that using DOV data with pygada is governed by the same [disclaimer](https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/page/disclaimer) that applies to the other DOV services. Be sure to consult it when using DOV data with pygada.
